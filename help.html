<!--- Main Text --->
<p> ADHD in Girls/women presents differently than in boys/men so it goes undiagnosed way too often. Undiagnosed ADHD in girls/women can lead to serious issues like; depression, anxiety disorders, low self-esteem, and eating disorders. Even if the ADHD symptoms subside as they grow, these issues can stick around forever, and in most cases can be detrimental to their health and wellbeing.
